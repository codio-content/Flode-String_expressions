One of the things that can be confusing is the way that strings behave when they are numbers.

Take a look at this.

```javascript
10 + 20 = 30
```

And now look at this.

```javascript
'10' + '20' = '1020'
```

See the difference? In the first example, we are dealing with numbers (there are no quotes around the numbers) whereas in the second example, they are strings.

## Number + String
There is another case, shown in the Flode chart on the left, where we add a string and a number together.

In Flode (and Javascript) if any of the variables you are adding together is a string, the the resultant value also a string.
