One of the things that can be confusing is the way that strings behave when they are numbers.

Take a look at this.

```javascript
10 + 20 = 30
```

And now look at this.

```javascript
'10' + '20' = '1020'
```

See the difference? In the first example, we are dealing with numbers (there are no quotes around the numbers) whereas in the second example, they are strings.
