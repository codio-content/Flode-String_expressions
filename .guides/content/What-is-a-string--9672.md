A string is a piece of text. It can be a character, a word or a load of words.

Here are some valid strings.

```javascript
h
hello
hello world
oh no!%$^%$
```

To create a string in Flode (and in most programming languages in fact), you need to enclose it between apostrophes like this `'my string'`.

You can also use quotes like this `"my string"`.
